iCal4j is a Java library used to read and
write iCalendar data streams as defined in
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2445.html">RFC2445</a>.
The iCalendar standard provides a common data format used to store information about
calendar-specific data such as events, appointments, to-do lists, etc.
All of the popular calendaring tools, such as Lotus Notes, Outlook and Apple's iCal
also support the iCalendar standard.

Providing both a parser and an object model, iCal4j allows
you to either modify existing iCalendar data or create new
data models. Validation is also provided to ensure the
data maintains a state consistent with the specification.
