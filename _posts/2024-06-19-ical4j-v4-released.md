title: iCal4j v4 Released!
---

Version 4.0.0 of iCal4j is now available!

This release is the result of [607 commits](https://github.com/ical4j/ical4j/pull/699) over 5 years, and
represents the largest major update to iCal4j yet.

Note that we will still support the 3.x branch for a while, but new features will be developed on the
4.x baseline from now on.
