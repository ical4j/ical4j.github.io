title: iCal4j vCard 2.0
---

A major refactor of the [iCal4j vCard] library is currently underway, with the first
alpha release [published](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:ical4j-vcard).

The focus of the changes are to align with the core iCal4j model (i.e. properties and parameters),
which will mean the vCard library can benefit from things like iCal4j validation and
filtering.

Feel free to look at the README or the
[API docs] and provide feedback and suggestions to help accelerate the development.
