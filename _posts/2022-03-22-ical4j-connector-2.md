title: iCal4j Connector 2.0

A major refactor of the [iCal4j Connector] library is currently underway, and by way of introduction the first
alpha release has just been published.

The initial release is not yet a complete implementation, but feel free to look at the README and provide
feedback and suggestions to help accelerate the development.
